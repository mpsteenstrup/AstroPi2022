# Idegenerering

## Mål

To participate in Mission Space Lab, teams will have to come up with an idea for an experiment that fits one of the following two themes:

## THEME A - LIFE IN SPACE
Teams that choose to investigate ‘Life in space’ will use the Astro Pi computer called Ed to investigate life inside the Columbus module of the ISS.
## THEME B - LIFE ON EARTH
Teams that choose to investigate ‘Life on Earth’ will use the Astro Pi computer called Izzy, including its sensors and its near-infrared camera facing out of an ISS window towards Earth, to investigate life on the planet’s surface.


### Eksperimentel ide checkliste
* Your experiment can’t rely on astronaut interaction. We can’t be sure when an astronaut will be around the Astro Pis, and they have their own working schedule!
* Your experiment shouldn’t be a game, but a scientific experiment!
* Real-time communication with the Astro Pis on the ISS is not possible, because we don’t have a radio communication module to be able to ‘give instructions’ from Earth!
* Don’t expect your experiment to run at a specific date and time. We can’t predict accurately when each experiment will run!
Only for ‘Life on Earth’ experiments:
* Don’t base your experiment on analysing the Earth’s temperature profile: that’s not possible with the Astro Pi hardware. The near- infrared camera is not a thermal imaging camera!
* Don’t base your experiment on night-time photography. Most teams that have attempted this in the past ended up with entirely black images that couldn’t be analysed.
* Don’t expect to photograph or film a specific event or location of your choice. We don’t know precisely where the ISS will be when your experiment runs, or whether a specific target on the ground will be visible on its flight path.
*  It’s OK if you want to photograph specific types of targets like lakes or forests, but make sure to program the experiment with as many similar targets as possible to maximise the chance that at least a few of them will be captured when your program runs.
* The detail level of the camera is about 161 metres on ground per pixel (assuming the ISS is at 400 km altitude), so don’t expect to be able to see features like cars, roads, or buildings.
* Ensure you understand the ISS orbit. The ISS covers everywhere between 51.6 degrees latitude north of the equator and 51.6 degrees south of it. This means the ISS will never fly over places like Greenland, Siberia, or Antarctica. It is also unlikely that you will see the Aurora Borealis, because it occurs closer to the poles than these latitudes.
Only for **‘Life in space’** experiments:
* Storing pictures or recording video is not allowed.


## Brainstorm
Resultaterne af vores brainstorm kan ses i dokuentet [Idegenerering.pdf](/material/Idegenerering.pdf).

## ISS
Idegenerering handler også om at kende til emnet! Her er en kort video om ISS, [ISS video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtrVwX1ncqk).

## Den dobbelte diamantmodel
Man kan få overblik over en designprojekt gennem 'den dobbelte diamantmodel'.

### Øvelse
* beskriv hvor i den dobbelte diamant de forskellige faser af Astro Pi konkurrencen befinder.

Den dobbelte diamant er en meget lineær tilgang til designprocesser hvor man arbejder sig frem mod målet gennem fastlagte skridt.  Innovation og designprocesser bliver ofte beskrevet som iterative, hvor man vender tilbage og gentager.
### Øvelse
* Beskriv hvor i dobbelt diamant modellen man kan vende tilbage og hvilke faser det kan give mening at gentage.

## Konkretisering

Nedenstående skema kan bruges til at konkretisere sin ide.

```
Overordnet problemstilling
  -> Hvad vil vi gerne måle.
    -> Hvilke sensorer vil vi bruge.
      -> Hvilke svar på en overordnede problemstilling giver målingerne.
        -> Hvor vanskeligt er det at få målingerne.
          -> rededinering af den overordnede problemstilling.
            -> forfra.
```
Når projektet har en form hvor I synes at det I skal undersøge er interessant og muligt er I klar til at skrive projektansøgningen.


## Commit Your idea
**Tell us about your idea**
Head to the [Mission Space Lab web page](https://astro-pi.org/mission-space-lab/) to submit your experiment idea. You will need to give us some details about the people in your team, and answer these two questions:
* A. What is your experiment idea?
* B. How will you use the Astro Pi computers to perform your experiment?

Your answers to these questions will help us assess your experiment for its **feasibility**, **scientific value**, and **creativity**.
You will also need to decide on a unique team name. This name must have eight or fewer characters and contain no spaces. The team name should also only have alphanumeric characters — no symbols.
